//SecondExample.java: Method Overriding
/*Points:
Every method in Java can be overriden in the sub class.
U dont have virtual keyword in java, which implies every method is virtual. However, if u want to stop the sub class from overriding UR method, U could mark the method as final. final makes the method non-overridable. 
In IDEs U could use a directive @Override to ensure the rules of method overriding is enforced. The method signature of the subclass should match the method signature of the super class if the superclass's method is to be overriden.
